# CS-424_Project-01

In this project I build a ShinyApps.io dashboard (https://mzimin2.shinyapps.io/CS-424_Project-01/) to display the data from https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/, to which my Professor (Dr. Andy Johnson) preprocessed the data into a CSV file for us.

This project had 3 parts:
1) Show the data in 6 different ways (2 using bar charts, 2 using line graphs, and 2 using tables) whith each pair having the data representing both the "Production Amount" and "Percent of Total Production." And, the user should be able to pick which energy source (or all sources) to view.
2) Split the screen in half so the user can compare the data by selecting the State, Energy Source, and Year for two "regions," and use the 6 methods for visualization from number 1.
3) Split the screen in half so that the user can compare using heat maps of the Energy Source and Year for 2 "regions."
